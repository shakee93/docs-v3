Minify JS optimizes JavaScript code by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting, reducing file size for faster 
loading. It improves website speed, enhances user experience, and boosts SEO without altering functionality.

## Here's how RapidLoad Minify JS works:

1. **Identifying JavaScript Files:**
    *   RapidLoad searches your website's Document Object Model (DOM) for files with the `.js` extension.

2. **Minifying JavaScript Files:**
    *   Once identified, RapidLoad proceeds to minify these JavaScript files for optimized performance.

3. **Minifying Inline JavaScript:**
    *   Inline JavaScript within `<script>` tags is minified and served in real-time.

4. **Storage of Minified Files:**
    *   RapidLoad stores minified files at `wp-content/cache/rapidload/min-js/{file-name}-{file-content-hash}.min.js.`
    *   RapidLoad does not save the minified inline JavaScript as a file.

5. **Clearing Minified Files:**
    *   You can clear the minified JavaScript files by clicking the **Clear CSS/JS/Font Optimizations** button once you hover over the RapidLoad admin button on the WordPress dashboard bar.

6. **Replacing Original Files:**
    *   The original JavaScript files are not deleted but are replaced with minified JavaScript files renamed with the `Src` and version `(?ver=xxx)` details.
        *  Original file: `https://demo.rapidload.ai/wp-includes/js/script.js?ver=6.3.2`
        *  Minified file: `https://demo.rapidload.ai/wp-content/cache/rapidload/min-js/script-9a7d09a200c6.min.js`
7. **Re-minification on Version Change:**
    *   RapidLoad will re-minify and serve files if the original files undergo version changes.

## Automatic Exclusions

1. **Third-party JavaScript Files:**
    *   JavaScript hosted on a different domain is excluded from optimization.

2. **Already Minified Files:**
    *   Files marked with the `.min.js` extension are automatically skipped.
