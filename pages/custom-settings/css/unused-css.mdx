  The Unused CSS and Critical CSS optimization options cannot be enabled simultaneously. Enabling Critical CSS alone addresses the 
  "Reduce Unused CSS" and "Eliminate render-blocking resources" audits. If both are enabled, Critical CSS takes priority.

Unused CSS refers to the portions of stylesheets (not entire files) loaded by the browser but not applied to any elements on the 
page during its initial or complete rendering. This can include:

*   Styles for elements not present on the current page.
*   Framework or library styles not utilized in the design.
*   Legacy styles for features no longer in use.

  

**Benefits of removing unused CSS include:**

*   Faster page loading times by eliminating unnecessary CSS.
*   Optimized bandwidth usage for better efficiency.
*   Improved performance by focusing on essential styles.

With RapidLoad, removing unused CSS is straightforward and significantly improves your website's speed and efficiency.

  

## Boost Your PageSpeed Insights Score:

Removing Unused CSS in RapidLoad directly improves your website’s performance by addressing key PageSpeed Insights recommendations:

* **Reduce Unused CSS**

This feature enhances metrics like **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**, improving Core Web Vitals and delivering a faster, more user-friendly website experience.

## Here's how Unused CSS removal works:

**1.** RapidLoad examines your page’s structure (the DOM) to locate all the CSS files associated with that page.

**2.** It analyzes the CSS files to determine which styles are applied to the visible elements and which ones aren’t needed for the current view.

**3.** A new, optimized stylesheet is generated, containing only the styles necessary for that page. Unused styles are excluded to improve loading performance.

**4.** The optimized stylesheet is served to users when they visit the page, ensuring faster loads without affecting functionality or design.

**Important Note:**

*   **RapidLoad Files**: The optimized CSS files created by RapidLoad are 
temporary and will not overwrite your original CSS files.

*   **Original Files Are Safe**: Your CSS files remain intact, preserving your 
ability to update or revert changes as needed.

## How to check if RapidLoad Unused CSS is generated

**1.** In the optimizer: You will see a green bullet point and the text 
"Optimized," indicating the RapidLoad unused CSS file is generated and served on 
your site  

**2.** To verify if unused CSS is removed on a **specific page**:  

    * **View the page as a logged-out user**: Make sure you're not logged into the WordPress backend when accessing the page. 
If you prefer not to log out, you can open the page in Incognito mode instead.

    * **Open Inspect**: Right-click on the page and select "_Inspect_" 
(or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows, `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac).

    * Navigate to the Network Tab **Check for RapidLoad Generated files**: In the "_network_" tab, look for the CSS stylesheets starting with `uucss` This 
confirms that the Unused CSS is successfully generated and served.

Unused CSS option.

**2.** After clicking, a popup will appear where you can find the regenerate button at

first-out basis; refer to the "Managing the Job Table" documentation for details.
