# Critical CSS

Critical CSS is the essential part of your website's styling needed to display the visible (above-the-fold) content immediately. 
By embedding these critical styles directly into your webpage, you can ensure the main content loads quickly, even before all
CSS files are fully downloaded.

**Benefits of Critical CSS generations include:**  

- Faster page loading times by reducing unnecessary delays.
- A smoother experience for visitors, especially on slower networks or devices.
- Improved first impressions with content visible right away.
- With RapidLoad, setting up Critical CSS is simple and helps boost your website's performance effortlessly.

**Boost Your PageSpeed Insights Score:**  

The Critical CSS feature in RapidLoad directly improves your website’s performance by addressing two key PageSpeed Insights recommendations:

1. **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources**
2. **Reduce Unused CSS**

This feature enhances metrics like **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**, 
improving Core Web Vitals and delivering a faster, more user-friendly website experience.

## Here's how RapidLoad Critical CSS works:

1. RapidLoad scans your page's structure (the DOM) to find all the CSS files linked to that page.
2. Once it has the CSS files, RapidLoad identifies which styles are used to display the content visible on the screen when the page first loads (above-the-fold content).  
3. We will generate Critical CSS parallelly for mobile and desktop with separate files for each version. It will then identify the device and serve the specific files for each
4. These styles are then filtered out and placed directly into the page's HTML as inline CSS, ensuring the page loads faster and looks complete as soon as possible. 

The whole process runs **automatically**, making it hassle-free for you!

## How to check if RapidLoad Critical CSS is generated
  
1. **In the optimizer**: You will see a green bullet point and the text 
"*Optimized*," indicating the RapidLoad Critical CSS file is generated and served 
on your site.

2. To verify if Critical CSS is working on a **specific page** :

    * **View the page as a logged-out user** : Make sure you're not logged into 
    the WordPress backend when accessing the page. If you prefer not to log out, 
    you can open the page in Incognito mode instead.

    * **Open Inspect**: Right-click on the page and select "_Inspect_" 
    (or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows, `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac).

    * **Check for Inline CSS** : In the "_Elements_" tab, look for the `<style>` 
    tag containing the ID `rapidload-critical-css`. This confirms that the 
    ritical CSS is successfully generated and served.

    * **Check Device-Specific CSS**:
        *   On the desktop version, you’ll see the attribute 
        `data-mode="desktop"` within the `<style>` tag.
        *   On mobile, the attribute will display as `data-mode="mobile"`.
