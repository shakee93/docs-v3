RapidLoad offers three subscription plans, each designed to meet your needs for optimizing multiple websites:

*   **Personal Plan**: 1 site
*   **Professional Plan**: 5 sites

All plans allow you to connect **subdomains (**[**staging.example.com**](http://staging.example.com/)**)**, making it easier to manage your website's performance across various sections or projects.

  

### **Managing Your Licenses:**

To manage your licenses and connected sites:

1. **Navigate to the Overview section** in your RapidLoad account.
2. Under **Connected and Active Sites**, you’ll see all the sites linked to your account.
3. You can manage your licenses by: **Deactivating unused sites**.

*   Subdomains connected to your main domain do not count towards your site quota.
*   If you have reached your license quota, you’ll need to **upgrade** your subscription to connect more sites.
