# Automatic Renewal

RapidLoad’s auto-renewal feature ensures your subscription remains active without any interruptions. When you order a new license, upgrade, or renewal, our trusted payment provider(Stripe) securely saves your payment information.
  
If you don’t opt out of this feature, the system will automatically process your renewal based on your subscription type:

*   **Yearly Subscriptions:** Renew every 12 months.
*   **Monthly Subscriptions:** Renew every 30 or 31 days (depending on the month.)

## Reminders and Confirmation Email:

*   Two weeks (14 days) before your subscription expires, you’ll receive an email with details about the renewal, including the amount and the billing date.
*   Once the payment is processed, a confirmation email will be sent to verify the successful renewal.

 If you wish to disable auto-renewal, you’ll need to [cancel your subscription.](https://app.clickup.com/9018301622/docs/8crgq5p-1358/8crgq5p-1518) You can then manually renew your subscription on your preferred renewal date.

## What Happens If My Credit Card Has Expired or Insufficient Funds?

If your credit card has expired or has insufficient funds, the payment for your RapidLoad subscription renewal will fail. In such cases:

    *  **Retry Attempts:** We will attempt to process the payment up to **three times** over a span of several days.
    *  **Email Notification:** If attempts fail, you will receive an email notification of failed payment.
