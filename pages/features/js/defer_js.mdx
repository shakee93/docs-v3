Defer JavaScript improves your website's performance by **delaying the execution of non-essential JavaScript** until after the main content has loaded. This ensures that critical resources are prioritized, leading to faster page loading times and a smoother user experience.

## Benefits of Defer JavaScript:

*   Faster page rendering by prioritizing critical content.
*   Reduced initial page load times.
*   Enhanced Core Web Vitals metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
*   Improved PageSpeed Insights scores by addressing render-blocking JavaScript issues.

## How to Enable Defer JavaScript in RapidLoad

*   Go to the **Optimize** tab in the RapidLoad plugin.
*   Click on the **Customize Settings** dropdown.
*   Under the **JavaScript** section, find and enable the **Defer JavaScript** option by checking the box.
*   Click **Save Changes** to apply the settings.

## Here's how RapidLoad Defer JavaScript works:

*   RapidLoad scans your website's structure (DOM) to find all JavaScript files linked to your pages.
*   Once identified, RapidLoad marks non-essential JavaScript files to be deferred, ensuring they load only after the main content is displayed.
*   Inline JavaScript within `<script>` tags is analyzed to ensure essential scripts are not deferred while optimizing performance.
*   The process is automated, requiring minimal user intervention while ensuring optimal results.
*   RapidLoad manages deferred files efficiently to maintain a balance between performance and functionality.

## How to Check if RapidLoad Defer JavaScript is Working

To confirm that JavaScript files are being deferred by RapidLoad, follow these steps:

1. **Inspect Script Tags in Browser Developer Tools**:
    *   Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (usually accessible via F12 or 
    right-click > "Inspect").
    *   Navigate to the **Elements** tab.
2. **Look for the** **`<script>`** **Tags with the** **`defer`** **Attribute**:
    *   Locate the JavaScript `<script>` tags.
    *   Check if the `defer` attribute is present, which ensures the script is
    being deferred, improving page performance by loading non-essential JavaScript only after the main content.
3. **Identify RapidLoad's Optimizations**:
    *   Look for a custom attribute like `data-rp-defer`.
    *   This indicates that the script deferring was applied by RapidLoad.

**Example of a Deferred Script Tag:**

```xml
<script src="example.js" data-rp-defer defer></script>
```

**Clear CSS/JS/Font Optimizations** button from the RapidLoad admin button on the 
WordPress dashboard bar.

  

## Resolving Defer JS Conflicts

Based on your site's configuration, you may need to exclude certain files from 
being deferred.
