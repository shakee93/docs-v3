# Cancel Subscription
To cancel your RapidLoad subscription, follow these steps:

<img style={{ marginTop: '24px' }} 
src="/images/cancel-subscription.png" alt="Cancel Subscription" />

1. **Log in** to your RapidLoad account.
2. Navigate to the **Overview section**.
3. Click on the **Manage Subscription** button.
4. Select **Cancel Subscription**.


Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.


**For example:**

If you purchased a **yearly package** and cancel it after one month, you can continue using RapidLoad for the remaining 11 months of your subscription.

**Note:** Canceling your subscription **will stop automatic renewal** after the current period ends; you will still have access to all features until your subscription term expires.
