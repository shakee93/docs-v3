RapidLoad's **AI Diagnostics** is a powerful feature that allows you to run a comprehensive diagnostic report for your website. It provides detailed insights into audits and metrics that need optimization or resolution and guides you on how to address these effectively.

## How to Use AI Diagnostics

**Navigate to AI Diagnostics**

Once you've logged into RapidLoad, head to the **Optimize** section in the plugin . You'll find this next to the "Page Speed Insights" menu.

**Run a Diagnostic Report**

Click the **Run Diagnostics Test** button. RapidLoad will begin analyzing your website's performance and generate a report tailored to your site's specific needs.

**Review the Diagnostic Report**

The generated report includes:

    -  **Audits and Metrics**: A detailed breakdown of areas requiring optimization, such as unused CSS, render-blocking JavaScript, or large image files.

    -  **Actionable Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for addressing each identified issue.

**Take Action**

Follow the recommendations provided in the report. Many of the issues can be resolved directly within RapidLoad by enabling relevant optimizations. For more advanced fixes, the report will guide you through manual steps.
