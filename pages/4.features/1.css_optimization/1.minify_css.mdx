# Minify CSS?

Minify CSS optimizes code by removing whitespace, comments, and formatting, 
reducing file size for faster loading. It improves website speed, enhances 
user experience, and boosts SEO without altering the functionality.  

## Here's how RapidLoad Minify CSS works

*   RapidLoad searches your website's Document Object Model (DOM) for files with
 the `.css`  extension.
*   Once identified, RapidLoad proceeds to minify these CSS files for optimized 
performance.
*   The inline CSS files in the `<style>` tags are minified and served in 
real-time.
*   RapidLoad stores minified files at 
`wp-content/cache/rapidload/min-css//{file-name}-{file-content-hash}.min.css.`
*   RapidLoad does not save the minified inline CSS as a file.
*   You can clear the minified CSS files by clicking the 
Clear CSS/JS/Font Optimizations button once you hover the RapidLoad admin button on the WordPress dashboard bar.
*   The original CSS files will not be deleted but they will be replaced 
with minified css files renamed with the `Href` and version(`?ver=xxx`) details.
    *   Original file: [https://demo.rapidload.io/wp-includes/blocks/navigation/style.css?ver=6.3.2](https://demo.rapidload.io/wp-includes/blocks/navigation/style.css?ver=6.3.2)
    *   Minified file: [https://demo.rapidload.io/wp-content/cache/rapidload/min-css/style-9a7d09a200c6.min.css](https://demo.rapidload.io/wp-content/cache/rapidload/min-css/style-9a7d09a200c6.min.css)
*   RapidLoad will re-minify and serve if original files undergo version changes.

## Exclusions

*   Third-party CSS files "_CSS hosted on a different domain_" are excluded from 
optimization.
*   Files already marked with the `.min.css` extension are automatically skipped.
