# Lazy Load Iframes

Lazy loading for iframes is a technique that delays loading iframe content such as videos, embedded maps, or third-party widgets 
until the user scrolls to the iframe’s position on the page. This reduces the initial page load time and improves overall performance.

## Benefits of Lazy Loading Iframes:

*   **Faster Page Load Times**: Non-critical iframe content (like YouTube videos or Google Maps) loads only when necessary.
*   **Reduced Resource Usage**: Minimizes bandwidth usage by avoiding the immediate loading of offscreen iframes.
*   **Improved Core Web Vitals**: Enhances key metrics like **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** and **Time to Interactive (TTI)**.
*   **Better User Experience**: Speeds up page rendering, especially for visitors on slower networks or mobile devices.

With RapidLoad, enabling LazyLoad for iframes is simple and provides an instant performance boost.

## How to Enable LazyLoad Iframes in RapidLoad

1. Go to the **Optimize** tab in the RapidLoad plugin.
2. Click on the **Customize Settings** dropdown.
3. Under the **Iframes** section, find and enable the **LazyLoad Iframes** option by checking the box.
4. Click **Save Changes** to apply the settings.

## How to Verify LazyLoad Iframes is Working

To check if LazyLoad for iframes is working:

1. **Inspect the Page**:
    *   Right-click on your webpage and select **Inspect** (or press **Ctrl + Shift + I** on Windows, **Cmd + Option + I** on Mac).
    *   Go to the **Network** tab.
2. **Scroll Down**:
    *   Observe the iframe requests. Iframes located below the fold will only load as you scroll to them.
3. **Check for Lazy Attribute**:
    *   `data-rapidload-lazy-src`: Contains the original iframe source URL, ensuring it's loaded only when needed.
    *   `data-rapidload-lazy-method="viewport"`: Specifies that the iframe will load upon entering the viewport.
    *   `data-rapidload-lazy-attributes="src"`: Indicates which attribute (`src`) will be updated during lazy loading.
    *   `loading="lazy"`: Standard browser attribute for lazy loading support.
    *   `<noscript>`: Provides a fallback iframe for users with delay JavaScript.

### Example of Modified iframe with `<noscript>` Fallback

**Original iframe:**

```plain
<iframe src="https://example.com/embed/video" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
```

**Modified by LazyLoad:**

```plain
<iframe 
    data-rapidload-lazy-src="https://example.com/embed/video" 
    data-rapidload-lazy-method="viewport" 
    data-rapidload-lazy-attributes="src" 
    loading="lazy" 
    width="560" 
    height="315">
</iframe>
<noscript>
    <iframe src="https://example.com/embed/video" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
</noscript>


```

## Why is LazyLoad for Iframes Not Working?

If LazyLoad for iframes is not functioning as expected, check for the following:

1. **JavaScript Conflicts**:
    *   Other scripts or plugins may interfere with RapidLoad’s LazyLoad feature. Disable conflicting plugins temporarily for testing.
2. **Caching Issues**:
    *   Clear all caches (site cache, browser cache, and CDN cache) and reload the page.
3. **Excluded URLs**:
    *   Ensure the iframe URLs are not mistakenly added to any exclusion list.
4. **Unsupported Iframe Sources**:
    *   Some iframe sources may not support lazy loading. Check the source and test compatibility.

## How to Exclude Specific Iframes from LazyLoad

1. Go to the **Customize Settings** dropdown under the **Iframes** section.
2. Find the **Exclude Iframes** option.
3. Add the iframe URLs you want to exclude. Example:

```plain
https://example.com/embed/video  
https://maps.google.com/*
```

4. Click **Save Changes**.

## How to Test LazyLoad Iframes Performance

1. Use performance tools like **Google PageSpeed Insights** or **GTmetrix**.
2. Focus on improvements in the following metrics:
    *   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
    *   **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
    *   **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**
3. Observe a reduction in the number of resources loaded during the initial page render.
