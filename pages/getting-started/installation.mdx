  **Important Note for Safari Users.**

Safari may automatically unzip the downloaded file, which can cause issues during installation. To prevent this, you can either manually re-zip the file or disable automatic unzipping by following these 
steps:

- Open Safari and go to Settings.
- Uncheck the option "Open safe files after downloading."

This ensures you receive the plugin as a ZIP file, which is required for installation via the WordPress dashboard.
