  **Important Note for Safari Users.**

Safari may automatically unzip the downloaded file, which can cause issues during installation. To prevent this, you can either manually re-zip the file or disable automatic unzipping by following these 
steps:

- Open Safari and go to Settings.
- Uncheck the option "Open safe files after downloading."

This ensures you receive the plugin as a ZIP file, which is required for installation via the WordPress dashboard.

## Can't Install/Upload RapidLoad plugin

When uploading the RapidLoad plugin via the WordPress dashboard, you might encounter this error:

"**The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini.**"

This happens when the plugin file size exceeds the serverâ€™s upload limit.

### How to Fix This Issue

#### Manual Fix

It's possible to increase the upload limit using one of the methods below. The method that works may vary depending on your server setup and hosting provider. You donâ€™t need to edit all these files simply 
find the one that applies to your site.

In the examples below, "**64M**" represents a **64MB** file size limit. You can adjust this value as needed, but avoid setting it excessively high.

  **Important:** Before making any changes, ensure you back up your files.

1. **Modify .htaccess (For Apache Servers)**

Add the following lines at the end of your .htaccess file (located in the root folder of your site):

```php copy
php_value upload_max_filesize 64M
```

2. **Edit php.ini (If You Have Access)**

If you can access your serverâ€™s php.ini file, update:

```php copy
upload_max_filesize = 64M
```
Restart your web server if needed.

3. **Update wp-config.php**

Add this line to your wp-config.php file:

```php copy
@ini_set('upload_max_filesize', '64M');
```

#### Quick Fixes

1. You can Install the [RapidLoad plugin via the FTP](installation#manual-installation)
2. Use a plugin: Install [WP Increase Upload Filesize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-upload-size/) or [Increase Maximum Upload File Size](https://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-max-file-size/) to adjust the limit.
3. Contact your hosting provider: If the issue persists, request an increase in the `upload_max_filesize` limit from your hosting provider.

### How to Check the File Size Limit

To confirm if the upload limit has increased:
1. Go to **Media** â†’ **Add New** in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Check the **Maximum upload file size** displayed below the upload area.
